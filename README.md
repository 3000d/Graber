Graber i3 RElab
=================

This 3D printer design is base on the Prusa I3 Graber, wich is a laser cut version of Prusa I3.

This version is made for metric fastenings. It contains a Illustrator file with symbols, so that most common shapes can be modified a single time. This makes the design parametric - well, sort of.

Usage
=====

financially contributing back to its continued development and maintenance.
