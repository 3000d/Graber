Graber 3D Printer
=================

This is the home of the Graber 3D printer, as seen on

I have decided to give it a name as the design is enough of a departure from its predecessor
that it needs differentiating. I am calling it the "Graber" 3D printer. Note on
pronunciation: the 'a' in 'Graber' is long.

This printer design takes a lot of inspiration from Josef Prusa's awesome 
Prusa i3 printer:

What I have done is completely redesign the entire i3 concept to make it laser 
cuttable.  Some designs have taken this idea part-way, making the frame laser
cuttable along with certain motor mounts. With my design, there are no printed
parts, although one could print certain parts if need-be.  

The overall build envelope dimensions remain the same as the Prusa i3.

A bill of materials is forthcoming. That said, it is really pretty straight-forward
once you have the laser cut frame put together. I will also add some basic labeling
to each part to make assembly easier.
