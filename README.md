Graber 3D Printer
=================

This is the future home of the Graber 3D printer, as seen on

I have decided to give it a name as it is enough of a departure from its predecessor
that it needs differentiating. It's name is the "Graber 3D Printer."
This printer design takes a lot of inspiration
from Josef Prusa's awesome i3 printer design:

http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3_Build_Manual#Single_Sheet_Frame_Style

What I have done is completely redesign the entire i3 printer to make it laser 
cuttable.  Some designs have taken this idea part-way, making the frame laser
cuttable along with certain motor mounts. With my design, there are no printed
parts, although one could print certain parts if need-be.  

The overall build envelope dimensions remain the same as the Prusa i3.
