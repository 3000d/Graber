Graber 3D Printer
=================

This is the home of the Graber 3D printer.

This printer design takes a lot of inspiration from Josef Prusa's awesome 
Prusa i3 printer:

http://reprap.org/wiki/Prusa_i3_Build_Manual#Single_Sheet_Frame_Style

I have decided to give it a name as the design is enough of a departure from its predecessor
that it needs differentiating. I am calling it the "Graber" 3D printer. Note on
pronunciation: the 'a' in 'Graber' is long.

What I have done is completely redesign the entire i3 concept to make it laser 
cuttable.  Some designs have taken this idea part-way, making the frame laser
cuttable along with certain motor mounts. With my design, there are no printed
parts, although one could print certain parts if need-be.  

The overall build envelope dimensions remain the same as the Prusa i3.

A bill of materials is forthcoming. That said, it is really pretty straight-forward
once you have the laser cut frame put together. I will also add some basic labeling
to each part to make assembly easier.

NOTE: The long term goal is to make this 3D printer completely laser cuttable.
Right now the x-motor and x-idler parts remain the only parts that are not
laser cuttable. These parts will follow soon.  If you choose to build this printer
before these parts are released, you can use the standard Prusa i3 x-motor and x-idler
parts and the printer will work fine.

If you find a bug, I welcome notifications, fixes, and even new contributions.
